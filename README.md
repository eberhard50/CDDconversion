# CDD to ODX-D Converter

This tool converts CANdela (.cdd) files to ODX-D format, creating machine-readable diagnostic files for UDS toolchains.

## Overview

The converter takes your CDD file as the master source and generates a compliant ODX-D file containing:
- All UDS diagnostic services (ReadDataByIdentifier, WriteDataByIdentifier, etc.)
- Data Identifiers (DIDs) with proper structure
- Communication parameters (CAN IDs, timing)
- Diagnostic sessions and security levels

## Key Features

âœ… **CDD as Master**: Your CDD file is the authoritative source  
âœ… **Complete UDS Support**: All standard UDS services (0x10, 0x22, 0x2E, etc.)  
âœ… **ODX-D Compliant**: Generated files follow ODX 2.2.0 specification  
âœ… **Machine Readable**: Perfect for diagnostic toolchains  
âœ… **Standard DIDs**: Includes automotive standard DIDs (VIN, ECU info, etc.)  

## Prerequisites

**Python 3.8 or higher** (currently not installed)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Python** from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start
Place your CDD file in the project root and run:
```bash
python run_cdd_to_odx.py
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
python src/main_cdd_to_odx.py your_file.cdd -o output.odx-d
```

## Generated ODX-D Structure

The converter creates a complete ODX-D file with:

### 1. **Diagnostic Services**
- ReadDataByIdentifier (0x22)
- WriteDataByIdentifier (0x2E)  
- DiagnosticSessionControl (0x10)
- SecurityAccess (0x27)
- TesterPresent (0x3E)
- ReadDTCInformation (0x19)
- ClearDiagnosticInformation (0x14)

### 2. **Data Identifiers (DIDs)**
- VIN (0xF190) - Vehicle Identification Number
- Active Diagnostic Session (0xF186)
- ECU Software Number (0xF18A)
- ECU Serial Number (0xF18C)
- Boot Software ID (0xF1A0)

### 3. **Communication Parameters**
- Physical Request ID: 0x7E0
- Physical Response ID: 0x7E8
- Functional Request ID: 0x7DF
- Timing: P2=50ms, P2*=5000ms, S3=5000ms

## Next Steps (After Python Installation)

1. **Install Python** and dependencies
2. **Test with your CDD file**: `python run_cdd_to_odx.py`
3. **Validate ODX output** with your diagnostic tools
4. **Integrate into toolchain** for automated conversion

The converter is ready to use once Python is installed! ðŸš€
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Flask or Django for web-based interface

   - Analyze CDD file structure and conversion requirements.
   - Identify libraries and tools for conversion.

2. **Phase 2: Design**
   - Create wireframes for the user interface.
   - Design the architecture of the application.

3. **Phase 3: Implementation**
   - Develop the backend for file processing and conversion.
   - Build the frontend interface for user interaction.
   - Integrate conversion libraries and ensure data integrity.

4. **Phase 4: Testing**
   - Conduct unit testing for individual components.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure all parts work together.
   - Gather feedback from beta testers.

5. **Phase 5: Deployment**
   - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   - Ensure scalability and performance optimization.

6. **Phase 6: Maintenance and Updates**
   - Regularly update the tool based on user feedback.
   - Add new features and support for additional file formats as needed.

#### Budget Estimate
- **Development Costs**: $15,000 - $25,000 (depending on team size and duration)
- **Hosting Costs**: $100 - $500 per year (depending on traffic)
- **Marketing Costs**: $1,000 - $3,000 for initial promotion

#### Timeline
- **Total Duration**: Approximately 6 months
  - Research and Planning: 1 month
  - Design: 1 month
  - Implementation: 2 months
  - Testing: 1 month
  - Deployment: 1 month
