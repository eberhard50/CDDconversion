# CDD Converter Tool

A comprehensive tool for converting CANdela (CDD) files to multiple output formats including ODX-D, PDF documentation, and HTML overview reports.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Triple-Format Output**: Convert CDD files to ODX-D, PDF, and HTML formats simultaneously
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Flask web application for easy file uploads and conversions
- **Enhanced CDD Parser**: Comprehensive parsing of CANdela database files
- **Professional Output**: High-quality PDF documentation and responsive HTML reports
- **Data Consistency**: All output formats use identical parsed data for consistency  

## Prerequisites

**Python 3.8 or higher** (currently not installed)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Python** from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start
Place your CDD file in the project root and run:
```bash
python run_cdd_to_odx.py
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
python src/main_cdd_to_odx.py your_file.cdd -o output.odx-d
```

## Generated ODX-D Structure

The converter creates a complete ODX-D file with:

### 1. **Diagnostic Services**
- ReadDataByIdentifier (0x22)
- WriteDataByIdentifier (0x2E)  
- DiagnosticSessionControl (0x10)
- SecurityAccess (0x27)
- TesterPresent (0x3E)
- ReadDTCInformation (0x19)
- ClearDiagnosticInformation (0x14)

### 2. **Data Identifiers (DIDs)**
- VIN (0xF190) - Vehicle Identification Number
- Active Diagnostic Session (0xF186)
- ECU Software Number (0xF18A)
- ECU Serial Number (0xF18C)
- Boot Software ID (0xF1A0)

### 3. **Communication Parameters**
- Physical Request ID: 0x7E0
- Physical Response ID: 0x7E8
- Functional Request ID: 0x7DF
- Timing: P2=50ms, P2*=5000ms, S3=5000ms

## Next Steps (After Python Installation)

1. **Install Python** and dependencies
2. **Test with your CDD file**: `python run_cdd_to_odx.py`
3. **Validate ODX output** with your diagnostic tools
4. **Integrate into toolchain** for automated conversion

The converter is ready to use once Python is installed! ðŸš€
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Flask or Django for web-based interface
