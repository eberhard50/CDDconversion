### Project Proposal: CDD File Converter Tool

#### Project Overview
The CDD File Converter Tool aims to provide users with a seamless way to convert CDD (Chemical Data Dictionary) files into various document formats, including human-readable PDFs, Word documents, and HTML files. This tool will cater to researchers, chemists, and data analysts who need to share and present chemical data in a more accessible format.

#### Objectives
1. **File Conversion**: Develop a tool that can convert CDD files into multiple formats.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an intuitive interface that allows users to easily upload CDD files and select desired output formats.
3. **Human-Readable Output**: Ensure that the PDF output is formatted for easy reading and comprehension, including tables, charts, and annotations.
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the tool works on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
5. **Documentation and Support**: Provide comprehensive documentation and user support for troubleshooting and guidance.

#### Key Features
1. **Input Formats**: Support for various CDD file versions and formats.
2. **Output Formats**:
   - PDF (with options for layout and design)
   - Microsoft Word (DOCX)
   - HTML
   - CSV (for data extraction)
3. **Customization Options**:
   - Users can customize the layout of the PDF (e.g., font size, color scheme).
   - Options to include/exclude specific data fields.
4. **Batch Processing**: Allow users to convert multiple CDD files at once.
5. **Preview Functionality**: Enable users to preview the output before finalizing the conversion.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage invalid CDD files or conversion issues.

#### Technical Specifications
- **Programming Language**: Python (for backend processing)
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Flask or Django (for web interface)
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - ReportLab or WeasyPrint (for PDF generation)
- **Database**: SQLite (for storing user preferences and conversion history)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for user interface)

#### Development Plan
1. **Phase 1: Research and Planning**
   - Analyze existing CDD file formats and specifications.
   - Define user requirements and gather feedback from potential users.

2. **Phase 2: Design**
   - Create wireframes for the user interface.
   - Design the architecture of the application.

3. **Phase 3: Implementation**
   - Develop the backend logic for file conversion.
   - Implement the frontend interface.
   - Integrate the conversion logic with the user interface.

4. **Phase 4: Testing**
   - Conduct unit testing and integration testing.
   - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with a group of target users.

5. **Phase 5: Deployment**
   - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   - Ensure scalability and performance optimization.

6. **Phase 6: Documentation and Support**
   - Create user manuals and technical documentation.
   - Set up a support system for user inquiries and issues.

#### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 month
- **Phase 2**: 1 month
- **Phase 3**: 3 months
- **Phase 4**: 1 month
- **Phase 5**: 1 month
- **Phase 6**: Ongoing

#### Budget Estimate
