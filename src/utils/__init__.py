### Project Proposal: CDD File Converter Tool

#### Project Overview
The CDD File Converter Tool is designed to convert CDD (Chemical Data Dictionary) files into various document formats, including human-readable PDFs, Word documents, and HTML files. This tool aims to facilitate the accessibility and usability of chemical data for researchers, educators, and industry professionals.

#### Objectives
1. **File Conversion**: Convert CDD files into multiple formats (PDF, Word, HTML).
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive interface for users to easily upload CDD files and select desired output formats.
3. **Customization Options**: Allow users to customize the output format (e.g., layout, font size, inclusion of metadata).
4. **Batch Processing**: Enable users to convert multiple CDD files simultaneously.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the tool works on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

#### Target Audience
- Chemists and researchers in academia and industry.
- Educators and students in chemistry-related fields.
- Regulatory agencies and organizations that require chemical data documentation.

#### Features
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Support for various CDD file versions and formats.
   - Validation of CDD file structure before conversion.

2. **Output Formats**:
   - PDF: Generate a well-structured, human-readable document.
   - Word: Create editable documents for further customization.
   - HTML: Produce web-friendly documents for online access.

3. **Customization Options**:
   - Selectable templates for PDF and Word outputs.
   - Options to include/exclude specific sections of the CDD file.
   - Customizable metadata (title, author, date).

4. **Batch Processing**:
   - Drag-and-drop functionality for multiple file uploads.
   - Progress tracking for ongoing conversions.

5. **User Interface**:
   - Simple and clean design for ease of use.
   - Step-by-step wizard for guiding users through the conversion process.

6. **Help and Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive user manual and FAQs.
   - Tooltips and in-app guidance for new users.

#### Technical Specifications
- **Programming Language**: Python (for backend processing) with a web framework like Flask or Django.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vue.js for dynamic components).
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `reportlab` or `WeasyPrint` for PDF generation.
  - `python-docx` for Word document creation.
  - `BeautifulSoup` for HTML generation.
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing user preferences and conversion history.
