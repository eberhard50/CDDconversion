### Project Proposal: CDD File Converter Tool

#### Project Overview
The CDD File Converter Tool is designed to convert CDD (Component Data Document) files into various document formats, including human-readable PDFs, Word documents, and HTML files. This tool aims to facilitate the accessibility and usability of CDD files for a broader audience, including engineers, project managers, and stakeholders who may not be familiar with the CDD format.

#### Objectives
1. **File Conversion**: Enable conversion of CDD files into multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive interface for users to easily upload CDD files and select desired output formats.
3. **Human-Readable Output**: Ensure that the PDF output is formatted for easy reading, with appropriate headings, tables, and graphics.
4. **Batch Processing**: Allow users to convert multiple CDD files at once.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the tool works on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

#### Features
- **Input Formats**: Support for various versions of CDD files.
- **Output Formats**: 
  - PDF (human-readable)
  - DOCX (Microsoft Word)
  - HTML (web format)
- **Preview Functionality**: Allow users to preview the converted document before finalizing the conversion.
- **Customization Options**: Users can customize the output format (e.g., font size, layout) for PDFs and Word documents.
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages for unsupported file formats or conversion issues.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive user manual and online help resources.

#### Technical Specifications
- **Programming Language**: Python (for backend processing)
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Flask or Django (for web interface)
  - Pandoc (for document conversion)
  - ReportLab or WeasyPrint (for PDF generation)
- **Database**: SQLite (for storing user preferences and conversion history)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for user interface)

#### Development Plan
1. **Phase 1: Research and Planning**
   - Analyze CDD file structure and identify key components for conversion.
   - Research existing tools and libraries for document conversion.

2. **Phase 2: Design**
   - Create wireframes for the user interface.
   - Design the architecture of the application.

3. **Phase 3: Implementation**
   - Develop the backend for file processing and conversion.
   - Implement the frontend interface.
   - Integrate conversion libraries and tools.

4. **Phase 4: Testing**
   - Conduct unit testing for individual components.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure all parts work together.
   - Gather user feedback through beta testing.

5. **Phase 5: Deployment**
   - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   - Ensure scalability and performance optimization.

6. **Phase 6: Maintenance and Updates**
   - Regularly update the tool based on user feedback and technological advancements.
   - Provide ongoing support and troubleshooting.

#### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 6 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 6**: Ongoing

#### Budget Estimate
- **Development Costs**: $15,000
- **Hosting and Infrastructure**: $2,000/year
- **Marketing and Documentation**: $3,000
- **Total Estimated Budget**: $20,000

#### Conclusion
