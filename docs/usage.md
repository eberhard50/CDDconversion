### Project Proposal: CDD File Converter Tool

#### Project Overview
The CDD File Converter Tool is designed to convert CDD (Chemical Data Dictionary) files into various document formats, including human-readable PDFs, Word documents, and HTML files. This tool aims to facilitate the accessibility and usability of chemical data for researchers, educators, and industry professionals.

#### Objectives
1. **Conversion Capabilities**: Enable conversion of CDD files into multiple formats (PDF, Word, HTML).
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive interface for users to easily upload CDD files and select desired output formats.
3. **Human-Readable Output**: Ensure that the output documents are well-structured, formatted, and easy to read.
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the tool works on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
5. **Batch Processing**: Allow users to convert multiple CDD files simultaneously.

#### Key Features
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop functionality for easy file uploads.
- **Format Selection**: Options to select output formats (PDF, Word, HTML).
- **Preview Functionality**: Preview the converted document before finalizing the conversion.
- **Customizable Templates**: Allow users to choose or create templates for the output documents.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extract and display relevant metadata from the CDD files in the output.
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and logs for troubleshooting.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive user manual and online help resources.

#### Technical Specifications
- **Programming Languages**: Python (for backend processing), JavaScript (for frontend interface).
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - **PDF Generation**: ReportLab or WeasyPrint for PDF creation.
  - **Word Document Generation**: python-docx for Word file creation.
  - **HTML Generation**: Use standard HTML/CSS for web output.
  - **Frontend Framework**: React or Vue.js for a responsive user interface.
- **Database**: SQLite or JSON for storing user preferences and templates.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, making it easy to deploy on various platforms.
