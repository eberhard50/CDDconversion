### Project Proposal: CDD File Converter Tool

#### Project Overview
The CDD File Converter Tool is designed to convert CDD (Chemical Data Dictionary) files into various document formats, including human-readable PDFs, Word documents, and HTML files. This tool aims to facilitate the accessibility and usability of chemical data for researchers, educators, and industry professionals.

#### Objectives
1. **File Conversion**: Enable conversion of CDD files into multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive GUI for ease of use.
3. **Customization Options**: Allow users to customize the output format (e.g., layout, font size, etc.).
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensure that all data is accurately represented in the converted formats.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the tool works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Target Audience
- Chemists and researchers
- Educational institutions
- Pharmaceutical companies
- Regulatory agencies

#### Features
1. **Input Formats**: Support for various CDD file versions and formats.
2. **Output Formats**: 
   - PDF (with options for layout and design)
   - DOCX (editable Word documents)
   - HTML (for web integration)
3. **Batch Processing**: Allow users to convert multiple CDD files at once.
4. **Preview Functionality**: Enable users to preview the output before finalizing the conversion.
5. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and logs for troubleshooting.
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive user manual and online help resources.

#### Technical Specifications
- **Programming Language**: Python (for backend processing)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `reportlab` or `WeasyPrint` for PDF generation
  - `python-docx` for DOCX generation
  - `Flask` or `Django` for web-based interface (if applicable)
- **Database**: SQLite or JSON for storing user preferences and settings.
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management.

   - Implement the user interface.
   - Integrate customization options.

4. **Phase 4: Testing**
   - Conduct unit testing and integration testing.
   - Gather user feedback through beta testing.

5. **Phase 5: Deployment**
   - Prepare the application for release.
   - Create installation packages for different operating systems.

6. **Phase 6: Maintenance and Updates**
   - Provide ongoing support and updates based on user feedback.

#### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 6 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 4 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 6**: Ongoing

#### Budget Estimate
